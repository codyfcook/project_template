# Slides 

Each set of slides should have its own folder, starting with the date. 

Slides should only reference tables/figures that are in an `input/` folder within. The `make.sh` script should copy necessary files over from the `2_output` folder. This way overwritting outputs won't change older slides. 

(Note that the current templates are from GentzkowLab -- feel free to change liberally)
