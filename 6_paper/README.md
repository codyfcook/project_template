# Paper 

The paper should only reference tables/figures that are in an `input/` folder within. The `make.sh` script should copy necessary files over from the `2_output` folder. This way overwritting outputs won't change older drafts. 

(Note that the current templates are from GentzkowLab -- feel free to change liberally)
